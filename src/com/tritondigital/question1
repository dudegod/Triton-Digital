Please provide code you have written that you consider high quality and production grade. If none is available, supply a sample of code from
another project (open source) which have the same qualities.

All the code I've done for the past years have been for projects at work and belongs to the company I am working for and thus can't be reprinted here. 
In general terms, good code should have cohesion and should be coherent. I guess we can put many libraries here but usually, Apache Commons is a good example.
